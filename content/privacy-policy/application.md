# Application Privacy Policy

## Introduction

The deployKF project is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. 
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the deployKF CLI (the "Application"), an open-source CLI application designed for managing Kubernetes deployments.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Application.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. 
We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. 
You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. 
You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

## Collection of Your Information

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. 

The information we may collect through the Application includes:

### Anonymous Usage Data

When you use the Application, we may automatically collect anonymous usage data to help improve the Application and understand how our users interact with it. 
This information may include, but is not limited to, the commands and subcommands executed, execution duration, error messages, command-specific parameters (such as flags and options), CLI version, operating system, and architecture.

### Unique Identifiers

To help distinguish individual users without collecting personally identifiable information, we may generate a unique identifier for each user. 
This identifier is anonymized and does not reveal any personal information about the user.

## Use of Your Information

We may use the information collected from the Application for various purposes, including:

- To monitor and analyze usage trends and preferences, and to improve the Application
- To identify areas of the Application that may need improvement, optimization, or additional features
- To diagnose and fix issues with the Application

We will not use the information collected for any other purposes not mentioned in this Privacy Policy.

### Disclosure of Your Information

We will not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share your information for marketing purposes. 

We may, however, share your information in the following situations:

### Third-Party Service Providers

We may share your information with third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as analytics providers. 
These service providers are required to protect your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and may not use your information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us.

## Security of Your Information

We are committed to protecting the information we collect and maintain. 
While no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, we implement administrative, technical, and physical security measures, such as encryption and access controls, to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. 
We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. 
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. 
Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
