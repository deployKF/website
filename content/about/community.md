# Community

The __deployKF__ project is a welcoming community of contributors and users.
We encourage participation from anyone who shares our mission of making it easy to build open ML Platforms on Kubernetes.

## Slack

The deployKF community uses the [Kubeflow Slack](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#kubeflow-slack) for informal discussions among users and contributors.
