# Get Support

While we aim to make __deployKF__ as self-service as possible, sometimes things go wrong, or your use case is a little different to the norm. 
In these cases, you have a few options.

If you have a question, or just want to chat, you can:

1. Post a message on the [Slack](community.md#slack)
2. Start a thread on the [Users Mailing List](community.md#users-mailing-list)

## Raise an Issue

If you have found a bug, or have a feature request, you can raise an issue on the relevant GitHub repository:
